## Introduction

Hi there! I'm Nerijus, and I'm on a journey to learn Python. This repository is a collection of my GUI projects, showcasing my progress and the skills I've acquired. I hope this can also serve as a resource for others who are learning Python.

## Highlighted Projects

- **Description:** This project is a Flash Card application built with Python and Tkinter. It helps users learn French vocabulary by displaying flash cards with French words, which the user can attempt to translate. After a brief interval, the card flips to reveal the English translation. The application tracks the words the user has learned, ensuring they are removed from the pool of cards to learn. The words are stored in a CSV file, and the user's progress is saved between sessions.
